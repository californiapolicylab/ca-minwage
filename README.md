# CA minimum wage dataset, 2004-2019

This repo contains quarterly minimum wage data from 2004 to 2019 for CA municipalities that have passed local minimum wage laws. The  minimum wage data includes quarterly local and state minimums, maximums, and averages identified in the UC Berkeley Labor Center dataset and corroborated with available city information. Starting in 2017, California's state minimum wage differed for businesses with fewer than or equal to 25 employees  and businesses with 26+ employees. Data from EDD on business size and total employment have been used to estimate the average prevailing wage. When local minimums had differing  wages by business size, the same approach was used. EDD categories were slightly different (see note in the readme tab of the Excel workbook) and were used as approximations. This dataset builds on Vaghul and Zipperer (2016)'s local minimum wage dataset.

The two `.csv` files are just cleaned up versions of the two tabs of the `.xlsx` file, for your convenience.

This dataset was compiled by CPL Summer Fellow Anna Larson.
